# ArrayListPeople
The program made for academic purposes is a CRUD where the user is able to CREATE, UPDATE, READ and DELETE people or a person in an ArrayList called "people". 

The ArrayListPeople class and the Person class should be in the same package in case you don't want to do any changes.

The code is available for those who need it. I hope you enjoy it!
